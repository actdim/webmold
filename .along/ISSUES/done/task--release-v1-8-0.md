# Release v1.8.0 and sync submodules

Minor release of the workspace: `pnpm run version:minor` bumped all packages from 1.7.2 to 1.8.0 (including `apps/server` and `apps/webapp`). No code changes in this package; version, Along context and KB index only.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `package.json` versions are 1.8.0 (root, `apps/server`, `apps/webapp`)
- [x] Along context refreshed to protocol v4.4.1
- [x] `.claude/settings.json` disables commit/PR attribution (no AI `Co-Authored-By` trailers)
- [x] Workspace `pnpm build` passing
- [x] Committed and pushed to origin/main
