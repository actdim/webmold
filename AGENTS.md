# ALONG-PROTOCOL v4.4.7

This repo carries its own agent context, provider-agnostically. Follow it every session, whatever tool you are.

## Scope, Precedence & Subproject Placement
- **Nearest Context Boundary**: Any folder may carry its own `AGENTS.md` + `.along/`; use the NEAREST ones for the area you're working in. On conflict, the more specific wins.
- **Subproject Localization** [gate: subproject-boundary]: In submodules, nested repos or symlinked folders: all entities (issues, sessions, ADRs, history) MUST be created in the NEAREST `.along/`. Agents are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from dumping subproject changes into the workspace root `.along/`.
- **Multi-Subproject Work** [gate: subproject-boundary]: A change spanning subprojects needs an issue in each touched `.along/`, or a root umbrella issue whose child issues there carry `parent: <umbrella key>`. Edits under a subproject `.along/` are checked by path.
- **Subproject Boundary**: only a nested `.git` or a user-run `along init` makes a subproject; never init a manifest folder.
- **Precedence**: Nearest `.along/` > higher-level `.along/` > global config (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.gemini/config/GEMINI.md`).

## At session start - read these yourself (they are NOT auto-loaded)
Use the NEAREST `.along/` for the area you're working in (fall back to a higher-level one if the folder has none):
1. `AGENTS.md` (nearest) - conventions to follow.
2. `.along/ISSUES.md` - active issue board (or query `/along-kb-search`).
3. `.along/CONSTRAINTS.md` - active architectural constraints (or full log in `.along/DECISIONS.md` / `.along/DECISIONS/`).
4. Active Issue file `.along/ISSUES/<type>--<slug>.md` for your task.
Also, when relevant: `.along/VISION.md`, `.along/GLOSSARY.md`. These reflect the state WHEN WRITTEN - verify any named file/API/flag against the real code first.

## Multi-Agent & Multi-Branch Concurrency
- **Zero-Manual-Merge Rule** [gate: projection-protection]: On merge conflicts in derived projections (`ISSUES.md`, `INDEX.md`, `DECISIONS.md`), accept either side and run `/along-issue-sync`, `/along-kb-sync`, or `/along-decision-sync` to recompile. `along git setup` registers merge drivers that do this automatically; afterwards run `along git sync`.
- **Append-Only Merge Driver**: `.along/HISTORY.md` and legacy monolithic `.along/DECISIONS.md` are append-only. Configure `.gitattributes` with `merge=union`. Modular ADR files in `.along/DECISIONS/` are isolated per-file to eliminate merge collisions.
- **Untracked Exports** [gate: untracked-exports]: `.along/dashboard.html`, `.along/DASHBOARD.md` and per-machine `.along/diagnostics/` stay out of Git.
- **Context Isolation**: Context is localized to the target issue file, session-scoped blackboard (`.along/.session/<slug>/`), and completed session logs.
- **Parallel Closeout**: `along session list`; on the user's yes `along plan approve --closeout --ready`, then `along session close --ready`.

## Mandatory Issue Anchoring
- **No Code Without Issue** [gate: require-active-issue]: Before modifying source code, agents MUST identify or create an issue in `.along/ISSUES/<type>--<slug>.md` and set `status: in-progress`.
- **Session Binding & Plan Approval** [gate: require-plan-approval]: `along start <slug>` binds THIS agent session to the issue; parallel sessions keep their own bindings. Source edits unlock after the user approves the plan (Claude Code: `ExitPlanMode`; elsewhere `along plan approve` only after the user's explicit yes). `along plan status` shows the binding.
- **Exemptions**: Read-only Q&A and 1-line micro-edits (typo fixes, comments) do not require issues.
- **Commit Binding** [gate: commit-issue-binding]: Every commit via `/along-commit` MUST bind to the active issue slug.
- **No AI Co-Authors** [gate: commit-no-ai-coauthor]: Commit messages MUST NOT carry `Co-Authored-By:` trailers naming an AI agent (GitHub lists the vendor as a contributor). `along hook install` turns runtime attribution off; opt out via `.along/config.json` `commits.allow_ai_coauthor: true`.

## Entity Ecosystem
- **Entity types**: Issues (`feat`, `bug`, `debt`, `task`, `docs`), Decisions (ADRs), Milestones, Risks, Spikes, Checklists, Sessions. Full YAML schemas: `docs/topic--domain-model.md`.
- **Canonical keys**: `<type>--<slug>` (e.g. `feat--token-refresh`). Reference by key, NEVER by file path.
- **ADRs**: Modular records in `.along/DECISIONS/ADR-YYYY-MM-DD--<slug>.md` (with legacy fallback to monolithic `DECISIONS.md`). Never edit past entries - mark superseded. Recompile projections (`.along/DECISIONS.md` board and `.along/CONSTRAINTS.md`) via `/along-decision-sync` or `along decision sync`.
- **Issue lifecycle** [gate: issue-lifecycle]: Close with `along issue done <slug>` (`status: done`, `completed`, moved to `.along/ISSUES/done/`).
- **Entity references** [gate: entity-reference-integrity]: Never delete an entity other entities reference; use `along issue rename` / `along issue supersede`.
- **Auto-entity creation**: Agents MUST automatically detect user intent (build/fix/refactor -> Issue, blocked/rate-limit -> Risk, compare/benchmark -> Spike, release/sprint -> Milestone) and create entities without prompting the user.

## Knowledge Base & Documentation
- **Stable Entry Point** [gate: stable-entry-point]: `README.md` and `docs/` never link into `.along/`; route through `docs/INDEX.md` or `docs/topic--<slug>.md`.
- **Portable Links** [gate: portable-links]: Relative Markdown links only.
- **Fact Grounding**: Agents MUST extract facts from actual code, `README.md`, `docs/`, and `package.json`. Generic LLM placeholders are strictly prohibited.
- **Fast Retrieval** [gate: fast-retrieval]: Agents MUST query `/along-kb-search` before reading whole documentation files.
- **Doc Blast Radius**: After non-trivial code changes, agents MUST map affected symbols to `docs/topic--*.md` articles and update them before completing the task.
- **Manual Document Lock** [gate: doc-manual-lock]: Documents marked with `write_policy: manual` (or `locked: true`) are protected from automated agent modification during blast radius sweeps. Modifications require an explicit documentation issue (`docs--<slug>`).
- **Managed Rule Packs** [gate: rule-pack-protection]: Never edit `.along/rules/**/*.md`; `along rules attach` owns them. Project guidelines go to `docs/topic--<slug>.md` or "Project specifics"; revert with `along rules restore`. `.along/rules/gates.yaml` and `.along/scripts/` stay repo-owned.
- **Documentation Routing Tree**:
  - Architectural choice / trade-off -> `.along/DECISIONS/` (ADR)
  - Public overview / pitch / landing page -> `README.md`
  - Technical interface contract / CLI spec -> `docs/topic--<slug>.md` (`type: reference`)
  - Conceptual explanation / comparison / philosophy -> `docs/topic--<slug>.md` (`type: explanation`, `write_policy: manual`)
  - Procedural walkthrough / runbook -> `docs/topic--<slug>.md` (`type: guide`)

## While working
- **Decisions**: Create new ADRs via `/along-decision-sync` or `along decision create <slug> --title "..."`. Add terms to `.along/GLOSSARY.md`.
- **Token hygiene**: Use quiet flags (`pytest -q`, `dotnet test -v q`), filter outputs, inspect targeted line ranges.
- **Lifecycle hooks first**: Agents MUST use `/along-test`, `/along-build`, `/along-dev` (or `.along/scripts/*.py`) before raw shell commands.
- **Post-change review**: Agents MUST inspect diffs and evaluate blast radius via `along graph-impact` (or static search fallback). Silent skips are forbidden.

## Stage & Session Completion Checklist
When a stage or session completes, agents MUST execute in this order:
1. [ ] **Tests** [gate: test_before_stop]: Run via `/along-test` with quiet flags. Zero failures.
2. [ ] **File Integrity**: `git status -u` - all new/modified files non-zero size, no empty placeholders.
3. [ ] **Code Review**: Inspect diff for side effects, verify REQ-N coverage, evaluate blast radius via `along graph-impact` (or static search), verify architectural decision compliance.
4. [ ] **Entity Reconciliation**: Close issues (`done` + move to `done/`), update milestones, resolve risks, conclude spikes.
5. [ ] **Doc Blast Radius**: Update affected `docs/topic--*.md`, `README.md` and Project specifics; add new terms to `.along/GLOSSARY.md`; touch `.along/VISION.md` only if scope/roadmap changed; run `/along-kb-sync`.
6. [ ] **Session Log** [gate: wrap_before_stop]: `along wrap <slug> --decisions <ADR...> | --no-decisions` writes `.along/SESSIONS/<YYYY>/<date>--<slug>.md` with the blackboard record; answer the decisions question explicitly.
7. [ ] **Projections** [gate: projection_sync_before_stop]: Run `/along-issue-sync` and `/along-decision-sync`.
8. [ ] **HISTORY**: Append line to `.along/HISTORY.md`.
9. [ ] **Compaction**: Advise user to run `/compact`.

## Rules
- **Contract-First Lifecycle**:
  - Agents MUST execute `.along/scripts/<action>.py` or `/along-test`, `/along-build`, `/along-dev` before raw shell commands.
  - When `.along/scripts/` is missing, `along test`/`along build` auto-detects and synthesizes hooks.
  - In submodules, execute the hook from that subproject's own `.along/scripts/`.
- **Environment Isolation**:
  - Agents MUST NOT install system-wide or global packages when a script fails. Fix the architecture (missing `bootstrap.ensure_deps()`, incorrect `uv` wrapper), not the environment.
- **Workspace Containment** [gate: workspace-containment]: Read and write only inside the workspace. Writes elsewhere are limited to the temp dir and runtime artifact dirs. Other repos need `allowed_roots` (`.along/rules/gates.yaml`, issue frontmatter, `along start --allow-root`). Never touch credential stores (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`).
- **Runtimes Without Along Hooks** (Claude Cowork, Cursor, OpenCode, plain shells): gates are advisory there. Agents MUST self-apply every gate-tagged rule and use the `along` CLI for tests, commits, entity changes, and wrap instead of raw tools. `along doctor` reports the enforcement level.
- **File Modification & Anti-Deletion**:
  - Never delete, truncate, or overwrite existing documentation, comments, or code unless explicitly instructed.
  - After batch edits or migrations, agents MUST run `git diff --stat` and inspect unexpected size reductions.
  - No stubs or skeletons in place of populated code [gate: anti_stub_injection].
  - Anchor edits on minimal unique chunks. Restore unintended deletions immediately.
- **Clean ASCII** [gate: typography]: ASCII punctuation only (no typographic dashes, quotes, ellipsis, bullets, NBSP/zero-width chars or BOM); `along sanitize --write` fixes them.
- **Markdown** [gate: code-fence-language]: Every code fence names a language.
- **File Content Via Tools Only** [gate: cli_safety]: Create/edit files with the agent's file tools. NEVER carry content in heredocs, `python -c`, or inline shell. Write scripts to a file first.
- **Verify Written Files**: After writing/patching, confirm parsing (`python -m compileall -q`, `bash -n`, etc.) before moving on.
- **Hermetic Tests**: Tests MUST target throwaway fixtures (`tempfile.mkdtemp()`), never the live repository. Read-only access to live state is allowed. Keep a meta-test that verifies `git status --porcelain -u` stays clean.
- **Inquiry Read-Only Invariance (Zero-Mutation Rule on Questions)** [gate: require-plan-approval]: On interrogative prompts ("is X done?", "why did Y fail?"), write/modify tools are STRICTLY PROHIBITED. Return a read-only audit report and ask for confirmation before modifying anything.
- **Mandatory Adaptive Complexity Escalation & Execution Mode Routing**: When scope touches > 3 files, crosses subsystems, or refactors core engines: single-agent execution is forbidden - route to `along-team`. Plans MUST declare `Execution Mode: Direct` or `Role-Based`. Role-based blackboards (`along scratch init`) are held to the step loop [gate: team-step-active] [gate: team-reviews-before-stop]; dropping it needs `along scratch fallback <slug> --reason "..."`.
- Windows-safe filenames [gate: windows-safe-filenames]: dates `YYYY-MM-DD`, date first.
- Keep `ISSUES.md` compact: `along context-budget --check` enforces the limit.
- Never write secrets into tracked files [gate: no-tracked-secrets].
